DirectShow Base Classes
=====

This file just contains the Microsoft DirectShow base classes wrapped up in a nice CMakeLists.txt for use with projects that use CMake but still rely on these old libraries.  Some modifications have been made to make these source compile without errors on the latest platform SDK, other than that they are provided more or less as they came with the Windows 7.1 SDK Samples.
